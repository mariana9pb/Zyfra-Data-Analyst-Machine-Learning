Predictive model to optimize gold recovery in industrial processes.


- Developed a regression model to forecast gold concentrate recovery rates in different production stages.
- Improved model accuracy by correcting data mismatches between training and test sets, achieving a competitive MAE.
- Applied Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and KFold cross-validation for data analysis, scaling, and model training.
